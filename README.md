# Project Summary



## Part 1

Part 1 of this project covers how we can use PySpark ML libraries to perform a sentiment analysis off of textual data. The data resides on Kaggle and [can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data). 

In this part, we leverage a Logistic Regression model (pending if this is the classification model)
