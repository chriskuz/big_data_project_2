# Project Summary

## Part 

Part 1 of this project covers how we can use PySpark ML libraries to perform a sentiment analysis off of textual data. The data resides on Kaggle and [can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data). 

In this part, we leverage a Logistic Regression model to identify toxic comments from a sample textual corpus. 

NOTE: This required an official registration with the competition and required account verification.
